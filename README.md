# HyperFlipBX90000Dominator
A stand-alone webpage that flips through the glyphs of a font. The page uses `opentype.js` to achieve this, it is in the header so no internet connection is needed.

##  How to use the HyperFlip BX 90000 Dominator
Open the HTML page in a browser and drop a font on it. It will read OTF or TTF, static and variable.

## Keyboard shortcuts
Pressing the `Space` key on your keyboard pauses/resumes the animation. Pressing either `arrow left` or `h` moves ten glyphs back, and pressing either `arrow right` or `l` moves ten glyphs forward. Pressing either `arrow up` or `k` moves one glyph forward, and pressing either `arrow down` or `j` will move one glyph back.

**HyperFlipBX90000Dominator** will display the most common axes present in your font, if your font is variable.

In the upper right corner there is a `Fullscreen` button. It full-screens **HyperFlipBX90000Dominator**.

In the control panel there is a `Randomize glyph order` button. It randomises the glyph order. Press it again and it reverts to sequential glyph order.

Once you have found a setting you like you can let it animate.
